# myco_testing
This repository contains gcode files for 3DP frames used for testing mycelium composites. The goal is to standardise myco testing.
The frame geometry is fixed, except for the infill type. This brings us to the testing parameters / variables:
  - Frame infill type
  - Frame infill dimensions
  - 3D printing material
  - Mycelium composite mix: substrate type
  - Mycelium composite mix: strain type
  - Mycelium composite mix: additions (e.g. rice flour, xanthan gum, ...)

Standardising mycelium composite materials testing, helps create a common ground and transparency. A lot of research on the topic can be found, but it is hard to compare studies since so many parameters come into play. In the hope that my thesis research can be the start of opening up the discussion of more transparency around myco materials, I provide a possible and accessible solution.
